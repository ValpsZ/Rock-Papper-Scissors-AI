# Rock-Papper-Scissors-AI
This is a rock papper scissors ai that sould be able to beat humans semi-consistently.

To use this ai run the code in python, you have to be able input things in to the terminal for it to work.
To play against it simply enter the move you make in to the terminal when it asks "RPS:" R for rock P for papper or S for scissor.
If you type something that the program does not recognize it will juat ask you to input again.

If you are wondering how this ai works let me explain it for you. It works by analyzing your habits, not by looking how ofte you pick rock or so but how often you use a diffrent strategy and when you switch.
The three strats are parrying (going the same thing as last turn), loseing going the thing that you would of beat last turn, and last picking the thing that would be your self last turn.
It keeps track of all of this in three difrent "Marcov chains". I'm no expert when it comes to marcov chains so if you want more information about it the you can google it your self.

Thanks so much for useing the ai and any responsy is gladly appreciate.
